# UPS On-Time Analytics

### Synopsis and Motivation
* The main purpose of this application to provide UPS administrators with statistical delivery data

### Description
The UPS On-Time project is a program designed to take the tracking data provided by UPS and transform it into data and anayltics that are specific to a certain area.The program aims to compare the time that UPS expects a package to arrive (ie: 8:00 PM of the day of delivery) against the time that the package actually reaches the  customer. After this data is recieved, the program takes those times and compares it against other recent deliveries in that area, namely zipcode. After that, the data is computed into various statstics, such as the percentage of packages in a given zipcode that were delivered before 8:00 PM, or the percentage of packages that were delivered 4 hours before their estimated time.
